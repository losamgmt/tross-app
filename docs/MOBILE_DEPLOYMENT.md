# 📱 Mobile Deployment Guide

> **🚧 STATUS: PLACEHOLDER - TO BE DETERMINED**
>
> This guide will be completed when mobile deployment is prioritized.  
> Currently, TrossApp focuses on web deployment with Flutter web builds.

## Why This Placeholder Exists

**Decision: Include placeholder rather than omit.**

**Rationale:**

1. ✅ **Shows roadmap awareness** - Acknowledges mobile is a future platform
2. ✅ **Prevents "forgotten" sections** - Easy to overlook undocumented areas
3. ✅ **Central reference point** - Collects related resources now for easy updates later
4. ✅ **Sets expectations** - Clear "TBD" status prevents confusion
5. ✅ **Completeness** - Documentation audit shows all deployment targets addressed

**Alternative (omit entirely):**

- ❌ Risk: Mobile deployment could be forgotten in future planning
- ❌ Risk: No central place to collect preliminary notes/links
- ❌ Risk: Looks like documentation gap vs intentional deferral

## 🎯 When This Will Be Completed

**Trigger conditions:**

- [ ] Business requirements prioritize mobile app deployment
- [ ] iOS/Android signing certificates acquired
- [ ] App store developer accounts created (Apple, Google)
- [ ] Mobile platform testing completed
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline extended for mobile builds

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 weeks for full iOS + Android deployment setup

## 📚 Preliminary Resources

**When ready to implement, start here:**

### iOS App Store

- [Flutter iOS Deployment Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios)
- [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)
- [App Store Connect Guide](https://developer.apple.com/app-store-connect/)
- Requirements: Apple Developer account ($99/year), macOS for signing

### Google Play Store

- [Flutter Android Deployment Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android)
- [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
- [Android App Signing](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing)
- Requirements: Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time)

### CI/CD Integration

- See [CI_CD.md](./CI_CD.md#-frontend-cicd) for build pipeline foundation
- iOS: Fastlane for automated TestFlight/App Store uploads
- Android: Gradle + Play Console API for automated releases

## 🔧 Current Mobile Support Status

**Flutter Configuration:**

- ✅ iOS project structure exists (`frontend/ios/`)
- ✅ Android project structure exists (`frontend/android/`)
- ✅ Platform-specific code ready for mobile
- ✅ Responsive UI works on mobile screen sizes

**What's Missing:**

- ⏳ Signing certificates (iOS/Android)
- ⏳ App store metadata (screenshots, descriptions)
- ⏳ Mobile-specific testing on physical devices
- ⏳ App store listing creation
- ⏳ Production build configuration

## 📝 Notes for Future Implementation

**Considerations when implementing:**

1. App naming and branding (TrossApp vs Tross vs other)
2. Version numbering strategy (semantic versioning)
3. Release cadence (weekly, monthly, on-demand)
4. Beta testing program (TestFlight, Google Play Beta)
5. App permissions (camera, location, notifications, etc.)
6. Deep linking configuration for mobile
7. Analytics and crash reporting (Firebase, Sentry)

**Questions to answer:**

- Which platform to launch first? (iOS vs Android vs simultaneous)
- Internal testing vs public beta?
- App store optimization (ASO) strategy?
