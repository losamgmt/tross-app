# CI/CD Documentation

Guide to TrossApp's continuous integration and deployment pipeline.

---

## Overview

**What runs automatically:**
- ✅ Backend tests (1675+ unit + integration tests)
- ✅ Linting & format checks
- ✅ Build verification
- ❌ E2E tests (run manually pre-merge - see below)

**When it runs:**
- Every push to `main` or `develop`
- Every pull request to `main` or `develop`
- Triggered by GitHub Actions

---

## CI Pipeline Stages

### 1. Test Backend (~70 seconds)

**What runs:**
- Unit tests (fast, isolated, mocked dependencies)
- Integration tests (real database, API endpoints)
- PostgreSQL service container spins up automatically

**Environment:**
- Node.js 20
- PostgreSQL 15
- Test database with migrations

**Required to pass:** ✅ All 1675+ tests must pass

### 2. Lint & Format Check (~10 seconds)

**What runs:**
- ESLint code quality checks
- Format verification (Prettier)

**Required to pass:** ✅ No linting errors

### 3. Build Check (~15 seconds)

**What runs:**
- Backend build verification
- Dependency resolution check

**Required to pass:** ✅ Build must complete successfully

---

## E2E Testing Strategy

**E2E tests DO NOT run on PRs** (by design)

**Why skip E2E in CI?**
1. **Security:** Fork PRs can't access backend secrets safely
2. **Cost:** 188 tests × 4 browsers = 752 executions (expensive)
3. **Speed:** ~5 minutes vs ~70 seconds for backend tests
4. **Trust boundary:** You review and run locally before merge

### Running E2E Tests (Pre-Merge)

**Your workflow before merging ANY PR:**

```bash
# 1. Checkout the PR branch locally
git fetch origin pull/123/head:pr-123
git checkout pr-123

# 2. Run full test suite
npm run test:all

# Expected output:
# ✅ Backend: 1675/1675 passing
# ✅ Frontend: 1553/1553 passing  
# ✅ E2E: 188/188 passing

# 3. If all pass, merge via GitHub UI
# 4. If any fail, request changes from contributor
```

**Post-merge verification:**
- E2E suite runs on `main` after merge (catches regressions)
- If E2E fails on main → immediate rollback

## Fork PR Workflow

**For Collaborators (working in forks):**

### What They Do:

1. **Fork repo** to their GitHub account
2. **Clone their fork** locally
3. **Create feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```
4. **Make changes** and commit
5. **Push to their fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```
6. **Create PR** from fork to `losamgmt/tross-app:main`

### What Happens Automatically:

1. **GitHub Actions triggers** on PR
2. **CI runs** backend tests, linting, build
3. **Status checks** appear on PR (✅ or ❌)
4. **Vercel bot** comments with preview URL (once set up)
5. **PR is blocked from merge** if tests fail

### What You Do (Maintainer):

1. **Review PR** in GitHub
2. **Check CI status** (must be green ✅)
3. **Test preview deployment** (click Vercel URL)
4. **Run E2E locally** (see above)
5. **Review code** and request changes if needed
6. **Approve PR** if everything looks good
7. **Merge** (only you can merge - branch protection)

---

## Branch Protection Rules

**Status after setup (see `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md`):**

✅ `main` branch is protected:
- Requires PR (no direct pushes)
- Requires 1 approval (you)
- Requires CI to pass (all checks green)
- Requires branches up-to-date before merge
- Only you can merge

**This protects against:**
- Accidental direct commits to main
- Merging broken code
- Merging without review
- Your own mistakes (even you can't bypass)

---

## Deployment Pipeline

### Frontend (Vercel)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` → Deploy to production
- Open PR → Deploy to preview URL
- New commit to PR → Update preview

**Auto-deployment:**
```
PR opened → Vercel builds → Preview URL in comment
PR merged → Vercel builds → Production deploy
```

**Preview URLs:**
```
Production: https://trossapp.vercel.app
Preview: https://trossapp-pr-123.vercel.app
```

### Backend (Railway)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` → Deploy to production
- (Optional) Push to `develop` → Deploy to staging

**Auto-deployment:**
```
Push to main → Railway builds → Health check → Live
```

**Platform-Agnostic Configuration:**

TrossApp's backend uses `deployment-adapter.js` for zero-config deployment across platforms:

- **Railway** - Auto-detects via `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT`, uses `DATABASE_URL`
- **Render** - Auto-detects via `RENDER`, uses `DATABASE_URL`
- **Fly.io** - Auto-detects via `FLY_APP_NAME`, uses `DATABASE_URL`
- **Heroku** - Auto-detects via `DYNO`, uses `DATABASE_URL`
- **AWS/GCP** - Falls back to individual DB environment variables

**No code changes needed** when switching platforms—just set the appropriate environment variables.

**Railway Environment Variables Required:**
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...  # Auto-provided by Railway Postgres
JWT_SECRET=...
AUTH0_DOMAIN=...
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=...
AUTH0_ISSUER=...
FRONTEND_URL=https://trossapp.vercel.app
```

Railway automatically provides `DATABASE_URL` when you provision a PostgreSQL database. The deployment adapter handles the rest.

**URLs:**
```
Production: https://trossapp-production.up.railway.app
Health: https://trossapp-production.up.railway.app/api/health
API Docs: https://trossapp-production.up.railway.app/api-docs
```

## Monitoring & Debugging

### View CI Logs

**GitHub UI:**
1. Go to PR or commit
2. Click "Details" next to failed check
3. View logs for each step

**Failed tests:**
- Logs show exact test that failed
- Stack traces included
- Can re-run failed jobs

### Common CI Failures

**"npm ci failed"**
- Cause: package-lock.json out of sync
- Fix: Run `npm install` locally, commit lock file

**"Tests failed"**
- Cause: Code breaks existing tests
- Fix: Run tests locally, fix broken functionality

**"Linting failed"**
- Cause: Code style violations
- Fix: Run `npm run lint -- --fix` locally

**"Build failed"**
- Cause: TypeScript errors, missing deps
- Fix: Run `npm run build` locally, fix errors

### Re-running CI

**If CI fails due to flaky test or infrastructure:**
1. Click "Re-run failed jobs" in GitHub Actions
2. Or push empty commit to trigger re-run:
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger CI re-run"
   git push
   ```

## Cost & Usage

### GitHub Actions

**Free tier:**
- 2000 minutes/month for private repos
- Unlimited for public repos

**Current usage:**
- ~2 minutes per PR (backend + lint + build)
- ~100 PRs/month = ~200 minutes
- Well within free tier ✅

### Vercel

**Free tier:**
- Unlimited deployments
- 100GB bandwidth/month
- Commercial use restrictions

**Current usage:**
- ~10 deployments/day (PRs + main)
- <1GB bandwidth/month
- Free tier perfect for MVP ✅

### Railway

**Starter plan:**
- $5/month base
- ~$5-10/month usage (compute + DB)
- Total: ~$10-15/month

---

## Security Notes

**Secrets management:**
- GitHub Secrets for CI (DB password, etc.)
- Railway environment variables for production
- Vercel environment variables for frontend
- **Never commit secrets to repo!**

**Fork PR security:**
- Secrets not exposed to fork PRs
- E2E skipped to avoid secret access
- Build runs in isolated environment

---

## Troubleshooting

**"CI stuck on waiting for PostgreSQL"**
- Usually times out after 30s
- Rare infrastructure issue
- Fix: Re-run jobs

**"Coverage upload failed"**
- Non-blocking (won't fail PR)
- Optional codecov.io integration
- Can ignore or configure token

**"Vercel deployment failed"**
- Check Vercel dashboard for logs
- Usually build command or env var issue
- Can redeploy manually from Vercel UI

---

## Next Steps

After CI/CD is fully configured:

1. ✅ Enable branch protection (see setup guide)
2. ✅ Connect Vercel for PR previews
3. ✅ Connect Railway for production backend
4. ✅ Configure Auth0 with production URLs
5. ✅ Test full workflow with test PR
6. ✅ Document for collaborators
