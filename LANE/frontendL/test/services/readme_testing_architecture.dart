/// Service Testing - Architecture Documentation
///
/// This file documents our approach to testing services that use static ApiClient methods.
///
/// PROBLEM:
/// - RoleService and UserService use ApiClient.get/post/put/delete (static methods)
/// - ApiClient creates its own http.Client internally
/// - Cannot inject mocks without architectural changes
///
/// SOLUTION:
/// We've built a complete mocking infrastructure that's ready for use when services are refactored:
///
/// 1. ✅ MockClient - Generated by mockito for http.Client
/// 2. ✅ TestApiClient - Injectable wrapper that accepts mock http.Client
/// 3. ✅ MockSetup - Helper class with setupGetSuccess(), setupPutSuccess(), etc.
/// 4. ✅ Full test coverage - see test/mocks/mock_infrastructure_test.dart
///
/// VALIDATED PATTERNS:
/// - GET requests with query parameters ✅
/// - POST requests with body validation ✅
/// - PUT requests with partial updates ✅
/// - DELETE requests ✅
/// - Error responses (404, 403, etc.) ✅
/// - Exception handling (network errors) ✅
/// - Request verification (was the right body sent?) ✅
///
/// CURRENT TESTING STRATEGY:
/// - Unit tests: Mock infrastructure (40+ tests) ✅
/// - Integration tests: E2E tests against real backend ✅
/// - Widget tests: Use fake services (FakeRoleService) ✅
///
/// FUTURE WORK (when implementing CRUD):
/// - Refactor services to accept optional ApiClient/http.Client
/// - Add comprehensive service unit tests using MockSetup
/// - Pattern: test/mocks/mock_infrastructure_test.dart shows exactly how
///
/// SEE:
/// - test/mocks/mock_infrastructure_test.dart - 40+ working tests
/// - test/helpers/mock_setup.dart - Mock helper utilities
/// - test/helpers/test_api_client.dart - Injectable API wrapper
